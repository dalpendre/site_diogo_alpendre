      <p>This project focused on designing and implementing a <b>Data Warehouse</b> in <b>PostgreSQL</b>, supported by a custom <b>ETL pipeline</b> developed in <b>Python</b> to automate <b>data extraction, transformation, and loading</b> of real-time vehicle location data.</p>
      <p>The data model was based on <b>Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)</b> protocols, including <b>CAM</b>, <b>DENM</b>, and <b>IVI</b>. For each protocol, the warehouse schema was structured around a centralized <b>fact table</b> complemented by multiple <b>dimension tables</b> to capture relevant attributes.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a <b>data seeder</b> was developed to generate test data and validate the correctness and reliability of the <b>ETL pipeline</b>.</p>
